## Use the VEXAI Jetson Nano Image
Download the Jetson OS image from this [link](https://content.vexrobotics.com/V5AI/Images/Jetson/VAIC2324_090623.gz). NOTE: This image is quite large so it may take some time to download.

You will need the following pre-requesities:

1. Download, install, and launch [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher). 
2. A formatted SD-card that is at **least 32GB**.

In Etcher, select the `VAIC_23_24.img.gz` from your download as the image. Pick the correct target to Flash to and then Flash using Etcher.

You should now be able to slot your SD card into your NVIDIA Jetson Nano and it will start running the VEX AI system.

The password to the Jetson (should you need to bring up the display and change anything) is `password`.
